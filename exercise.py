import random

# Exercise 0: Example
#
# This is a practice exercise to help you understand how to write code "inside" a provided Python function.
#
# We'll create a function that checks a condition and prints a specific greeting message based on that condition.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function is named `print_greeting`.
# - Inside the function, declare a variable `python_is_fun` and set it to `True`.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if `python_is_fun` is `True`.
# - If `python_is_fun` is `True`, print the message "Python is fun!"

def print_greeting():
    # Your code goes here. Remember to indent!
    python_is_fun = True
    if python_is_fun:
        print("Python is fun!")

# Call the function
# print_greeting()


# Exercise 1: Vowel or Consonant
#
# Write a Python function named `check_letter` that determines if a given letter
# is a vowel or a consonant.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function should prompt the user to enter a letter (a-z or A-Z) and determine its type.
# - It should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.
# - If the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), print: "The letter x is a vowel."
# - If the letter is a consonant, print: "The letter x is a consonant."
# - Replace 'x' with the actual letter entered by the user.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Utilize the `in` operator to check for vowels.
# - Ensure to provide feedback for non-alphabetical or invalid entries.

def check_letter():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    vowels = "aeiou"

    user_input = input("Type an upper or lowercase letter: ")

    if user_input.isalpha():
        letter = user_input.lower()
        
        if letter in vowels:
            print(f"{user_input} is a vowel")
        
        else:
            print(f"{user_input} is a consonant")

    else:
        print("Your input is invalid.")


# Call the function
# check_letter()

# Exercise 2: Old enough to vote?
#
# Write a Python function named `check_voting_eligibility` that determines if a user is old enough to vote.
# Fill in the logic to perform the eligibility check inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to input their age: "Please enter your age: "
# - Validate the input to ensure the age is a possible value (no negative numbers).
# - Determine if the user is eligible to vote. Set a variable for the voting age.
# - Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote based on the entered age.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture the user's age.
# - Use `int()` to convert the input to an integer. Ensure to handle any conversion errors gracefully.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if the age meets the minimum voting age requirement.

def check_voting_eligibility():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    user_age = input("Please enter your age: ")

#! note to self: isdigit() checks if the input is a non-negative number. Int then makes sure the string value is converted into an integer.
    if user_age.isdigit(): 
        user_age = int(user_age)
        
        if user_age > 15:
            print("Success! You are eligible to vote.")
        else:
            print("Sorry, you're too young to vote.")

    else: print("That's not a number!")
# Call the function
# check_voting_eligibility()

# Exercise 3: Calculate Dog Years
#
# Write a Python function named `calculate_dog_years` that calculates a dog's age in dog years.
# Fill in the logic to perform the calculation inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to enter a dog's age: "Input a dog's age: "
# - Calculate the dog's age in dog years:
#      - The first two years of the dog's life count as 10 dog years each.
#      - Each subsequent year counts as 7 dog years.
# - Print the calculated age: "The dog's age in dog years is xx."
# - Replace 'xx' with the calculated dog years.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Convert the string input to an integer using `int()`.
# - Apply conditional logic to perform the correct age calculation based on the dog's age.

def calculate_dog_years():
    # Your control flow logic goes here

    dog_age = int(input("Type your dog's age: "))
    
    dog_years = 0
    
    if dog_age <= 2:
        dog_years = dog_age * 10
    else:
        dog_years = 20 + ((dog_age - 2) * 7)
    
    # Print the calculated dog years
    print(f"The dog's age in dog years is {dog_years}.")
    
# Call the function
# calculate_dog_years()

# Exercise 4: Weather Advice
#
# Write a Python script named `weather_advice` that provides clothing advice based on weather conditions.
#
# Requirements:
# - The script should prompt the user to enter if it is cold (yes/no).
# - Then, ask if it is raining (yes/no).
# - Use logical operators to determine clothing advice:
#   - If it is cold AND raining, print "Wear a waterproof coat."
#   - If it is cold BUT NOT raining, print "Wear a warm coat."
#   - If it is NOT cold but raining, print "Carry an umbrella."
#   - If it is NOT cold AND NOT raining, print "Wear light clothing."
#
# Hints:
# - Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) in your if statements to handle multiple conditions.

def weather_advice():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    cold = input("Is it cold? (Yes/No): ").lower()
    rain = input("Thanks... is it raining? (Yes/No): ").lower()

    if cold == "yes" and rain == "yes":
        print("Brrr.. You should wear a waterproof coat.")
    elif cold == "yes" and rain != "yes": 
        print("Wear a warm coat.")
    elif cold != "yes" and rain == "yes": 
        print("Carry an umbrella.")
    elif cold != "yes" and rain != "yes":
        print("Wear light clothing.")


# Call the function
# weather_advice()

# Exercise 5: What's the Season?
#
# Write a Python function named `determine_season` that figures out the season based on the entered date.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function should first prompt the user to enter the month (as three characters): "Enter the month of the year (Jan - Dec):"
# - Then, the function should prompt the user to enter the day of the month: "Enter the day of the month:"
# - Determine the current season based on the date:
#      - Dec 21 - Mar 19: Winter
#      - Mar 20 - Jun 20: Spring
#      - Jun 21 - Sep 21: Summer
#      - Sep 22 - Dec 20: Fall
# - Print the season for the entered date in the format: "<Mmm> <dd> is in <season>."
#
# Hints:
# - Use 'in' to check if a string is in a list or tuple.
# - Adjust the season based on the day of the month when needed.
# - Ensure to validate input formats and handle unexpected inputs gracefully.

def determine_season():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    month = input("Enter the month (please use a three-letter mmm format, e.g. 'Mar' for March: " ).lower()
    day = int(input("Enter the day (in dd number format): "))
    
    if (month == "dec" and day >= 21) or (month == "jan") or (month == "feb") or (month == "mar" and day < 20):
        season = "Winter"
    elif (month == "mar" and day >= 20) or (month == "apr") or (month == "may") or (month == "jun" and day < 21):
        season = "Spring"
    elif (month == "jun" and day >= 21) or (month == "jul") or (month == "aug") or (month == "sep" and day < 22):
        season = "Summer"
    elif (month == "sep" and day >= 22) or (month == "oct") or (month == "nov") or (month == "dec" and day < 21):
        season = "Fall"
    else: 
        print("Invalid month and/or day!")
    #! Note to self: using return within the 'else' prevents an error from being thrown when an invalid input is entered.
        return
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"{month.capitalize()} {day} is in {season}.")
    

# Call the function
# determine_season()

# Exercise 7: Number Guessing Game
#
# Write a Python function named `guess_number` that allows a user to guess a predetermined number within a range.
#
# Requirements:
# - Set a fixed number as the target for guessing (e.g., 42).
# - Prompt the user to guess a number within a range (e.g., 1 to 100).
# - Allow the user to guess up to five times.
# - After each guess, use conditional statements with AND, OR, and NOT to give the user hints like:
#   - "Guess is too low" or "Guess is too high."
#   - "Last chance!" when they are on their fifth guess.
# - Print "Congratulations, you guessed correctly!" if they guess the number.
# - Print "Sorry, you failed to guess the number in five attempts." if they do not succeed.
#
# Hints:
# - Use a for loop with a range to limit guesses to five.
# - Use logical AND, OR, and NOT to check conditions and provide appropriate feedback.

def guess_number():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    #! I opted to import random in order to play the game myself..
    target = random.randint(1, 100)
    guesses = 5

    for guess in range(guesses, 0, -1):
        user_guess = int(input(f"Guess a number between 1-100: "))
    
        if user_guess == target:
            print("Congrats, you guessed correctly!")
            return
        
        if (user_guess - target) <=10:
            print("You're close.. ")
        elif user_guess < target:
            print("Too low. Guess higher!")
        else:
            print("Too high!")
        
        if guess == 2:
            print("It's your last chance! Make it a good guess...")
        else:
            print(f"You have {(guess-1)} guesses left.")
        
    print(f"Wah wah. The number was...  {target}. Better luck next time!")

# Call the function
guess_number()
